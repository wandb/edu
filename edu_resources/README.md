# Resources for Educators, Teaching Assistants, and Students

Below are some resources that you can make use of as a student, student instructor (TA, GSI), or educator.


We've included introductory content to help get you and your students started using _Weights & Biases_ to enable collaborative, repeatable machine and deep learning in your classroom, research lab, or student-run organization.

## Teaching with Weights & Biases

The resources below are targeted at educators or instructors who are teaching machine learning, deep learning or reinforcement learning courses who want to make use of Weights & Biases in the classroom. We've curated a mix of videos, slide decks, and free resources for educators to help you and your students build reproducible, collaborative models with ease:

## Using Weights & Biases with Your Favorite Library

Whether you use more traditional machine learning frameworks (such as [scikit-learn](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/integrations/scikit?utm_source=edu_resources_github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=q1_2023) or [XGBoost](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/integrations/xgboost?utm_source=edu_resources_github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=q1_2023)) or deep learning frameworks (like [TensorFlow](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/integrations/tensorflow?utm_source=edu_resources_github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=q1_2023), [PyTorch](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/integrations/pytorch?utm_source=edu_resources_github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=q1_2023), Jax, [Keras](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/integrations/keras?utm_source=edu_resources_github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=q1_2023), HuggingFace, etc.) Weights & Biases has you covered! Weights & Biases also integrates with [SageMaker](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/integrations/other/sagemaker?utm_source=edu_resources_github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=q1_2023), [Kubeflow Pipelines](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/integrations/other/kubeflow-pipelines-kfp?utm_source=edu_resources_github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=q1_2023), [Docker](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/integrations/other/docker?utm_source=edu_resources_github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=q1_2023), [Ray Tune](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/integrations/other/ray-tune), [Databricks](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/integrations/other/databricks?utm_source=edu_resources_github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=q1_2023), and even [OpenAI's Gym](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/integrations/other/openai-gym?utm_source=edu_resources_github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=q1_2023) for reinforcement learning.

## Contact us

Contact us at research [at] `wandb` [dot] ai if you'd like to learn more about W&B-hosted webinars for your class. With our 45-minute webinar one of our W&B staff will introduce your class or academic group to using Weights & Biases for your experiment tracking needs; participants will gain an understanding of the main functionalities of the W&B library and will be empowered to start using the tool in their daily machine or deep learning model training workflows. With the 1.5-hour webinar one of our W&B staff will introduce your class to our product for the first half of the webinar; to solidify student learning the second half of the webinar is devoted to an in-class Kaggle-like competition. At the end of either webinar - the 45-minute or 1.5-hour webinar - the participants will have developed

- an understanding of experiment tracking and reproducibility in machine learning: why it's important and how Weights & Biases can help you throughout your model-building lifecycle
- familiarity with the core features and functionalities of Weights & Biases
- comfort with system metrics: Am I using the right-sized GPU for the job? Have I under- or overprovisioned my GPUs?
