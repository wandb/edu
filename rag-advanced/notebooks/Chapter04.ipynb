    "\n",
    "2. **Context Deduplication**: To optimize the input to our LLM, the pipeline deduplicates the retrieved chunks. This ensures we don't waste tokens on repetitive information.\n",
    "\n",

    "Our comparison between the SimpleRAGPipeline and QueryEnhancedRAGPipeline reveals interesting insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Response Quality**:\n",
    "   - Both pipelines achieved similar correctness scores.\n",
    "   - The SimpleRAGPipeline showed a slightly higher overall response quality score (0.75 vs 0.70).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Latency**:\n",
    "   - The QueryEnhancedRAGPipeline exhibited significantly higher latency (21.40s vs 5.74s).\n",
    "   - This increased latency is likely due to the additional processing in query enhancement.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Detailed Analysis**:\n",
    "   - A careful examination of individual responses reveals that the QueryEnhancedRAGPipeline often generates more relevant and coherent answers.\n",
    "   - However, these responses tend to be more verbose, which may have led to lower scores from the LLM Judge, which seems to favor conciseness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Complexity vs. Performance**:\n",
    "   Adding sophisticated features like query enhancement doesn't always lead to immediate improvements in automated metrics. It's crucial to balance complexity with measurable performance gains.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Latency Considerations**:\n",
    "   In real-world applications, the significant increase in latency could impact user experience. This highlights the importance of efficiency in RAG system design.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Metric Limitations**:\n",
    "   The discrepancy between perceived quality and metric scores underscores the limitations of current evaluation methods. This suggests an opportunity to fine-tune the LLM Judge for more nuanced assessments.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Dataset Dependency**:\n",
    "   These observations are specific to our current dataset. The benefits of query enhancement might vary across different types of queries or datasets. It's essential to evaluate RAG improvements on diverse, representative data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Qualitative vs. Quantitative Analysis**:\n",
    "   This evaluation highlights the importance of combining automated metrics with qualitative analysis of individual responses for a comprehensive assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Iterative Improvement**:\n",
    "   These results provide a foundation for further refinement. We might explore ways to optimize the query enhancement process, improve response conciseness, or refine our evaluation metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "This evaluation underscores the complexity of assessing RAG systems and the importance of multi-faceted evaluation approaches. It also demonstrates that improvements in system design may not always be immediately reflected in standard metrics, emphasizing the need for ongoing refinement of both RAG systems and evaluation methodologies."
