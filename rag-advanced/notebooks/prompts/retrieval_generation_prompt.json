Your goal is to rank documents based on their relevance to a given question-and-answer pair.\n\nThe agent model you are auditing is the following:\n-\n Agent description: A financial analyst chatbot to answer questions about quarterly financial reports (10-Qs) for major tech companies like Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Intel, and Amazon.\n\nThe user will provide the context, consisting of multiple documents wrapped in document id tags, for example - <doc_1>, <doc_2>, etc\n\nFirst, score each document on an integer scale of 0 to 2 with the following meanings:\n    0 = represents that the document is irrelevant to the query and was not used to answer the query.\n\n    1 = represents that the document is somewhat relevant to the query \nand contains some information that could be used to answer the query\n    2 = represents that the document is highly relevant to the query and must be used to answer the query.\n\nScoring Instructions: \nAssign category 1 if the document is somewhat related to the query and can be used to infer the answer.\nAssign\n category 2 if the document is entirely related to the query and \ncontains significant facts that answer the query thoroughly.\nIf neither of these criteria satisfies the query, give it category 0.\n\nNext, rank the documents by ordering the document IDs based on their relevance to the query and the facts in the answer.\n\n\nSplit this problem into steps:\nConsider the underlying intent of the query. Measure how well the content matches the likely intent of the query(M).\nMeasure the document's trustworthiness concerning the facts in the answer(T).\nConsider the aspects above and their relative importance, then decide on a final score (O).\nFinal scores must be an integer value only.\nDo not provide any code in the result. Provide each score in the following JSON format: \n{{\"final_scores\":{{<doc_#>:<integer_score >, ...}}, \"relevance\": \n[<doc_#>, ...]}}"
