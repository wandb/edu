# Revenue Distribution Across Amazon's Business Segments

For the quarter ended September 30, 2023, Amazon's revenue distribution across its business segments was as follows:

| Segment | Net Sales (millions) | Operating Income/Loss (millions) |
|---------|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| North America | $87,887 | $4,307 |
| International | $32,137 | $(95) |
| AWS | $23,059 | $6,976 |

Key observations:
1. The North America segment generated the highest net sales and a significant operating income.
2. The International segment experienced an operating loss despite substantial net sales.
3. AWS, while having lower net sales compared to the other segments, had the highest operating income due to lower operating expenses [1].

This distribution highlights Amazon's diverse business model and the varying profitability across its segments.
