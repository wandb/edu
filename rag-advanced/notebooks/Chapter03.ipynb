    "## Data Ingestion and Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a method for integrating private data with pre-trained, instruction-tuned language models. The effectiveness of your RAG system is directly proportional to the quality of your data ingestion pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data ingestion encompasses both data sources and preprocessing. As with most machine learning systems, the principle of \"garbage in, garbage out\" applies to LLMs. Therefore, optimizing your data ingestion pipeline is crucial for RAG efficacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key considerations for efficient data ingestion:\n",
    "1. Periodic updates: Implement a system that can seamlessly update when data sources change.\n",
    "2. Quality control: Ensure data cleanliness and relevance.\n",
    "3. Scalability: Design the pipeline to handle increasing data volumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip**: When building your data ingestion pipeline, start with a small, representative sample of your data. This allows you to quickly iterate on your preprocessing steps and catch potential issues early. Focus on creating an end-to-end working system before optimizing specific components like chunk size, parsing strategies, or data formats (e.g., markdown, HTML, plain text).\n",

    "## Data Chunking\n",

    "2. It helps manage token limits in language models\n",
    "3. It can improve the overall efficiency of our RAG system\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll explore different chunking strategies and implement a semantic chunking approach, which aims to preserve the context and meaning of our text while splitting it into appropriate segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can split the processed data into smaller chunks. This approach serves two purposes:\n",
    "1. Reduce input token cost by sending only the required data for generation.\n",
    "2. Limit context to ensure the LLM focuses on relevant details.\n",
    "\n",
    "While sending the entire document to the LLM is possible, it depends on the total token count and the nature of your use case. This approach can be costlier but is a good starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Semantic Chunking\n",
    "\n",
    "Various chunking strategies exist, such as splitting after n words/tokens or on headers. It's advisable to experiment with these simple strategies before moving to more sophisticated ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we implement semantic chunking, a sophisticated strategy that has proven effective in practice. This method groups similar sentences into chunks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Split the text into sentences using the [BlingFire](https://github.com/microsoft/BlingFire) library.\n",
    "2. Group and combine chunks based on semantic similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic chunking offers key advantages over simpler methods like fixed-length splitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Improved Relevance**: Groups related sentences, increasing the likelihood of retrieving complete, relevant information.\n",
    "2. **Context Preservation**: Maintains logical flow within chunks, crucial for accurate LLM understanding and generation.\n",
    "3. **Adaptive Segmentation**: Creates variable-length chunks that better represent the text's natural structure and content organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "By keeping related information together, semantic chunking optimizes retrieval accuracy and enhances the RAG system's ability to provide contextually appropriate responses.\n",

    "# Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Quality is Crucial: The effectiveness of a RAG system heavily depends on the quality of data ingestion and preprocessing. \"Garbage in, garbage out\" applies to LLMs as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Accurate Tokenization: Using the correct tokenization strategy is essential for proper text processing and context management. The actual token count often differs significantly from simple word counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Preprocessing Importance: Cleaning raw data by removing markdown elements, special characters, and extra whitespace is crucial for optimizing LLM input and improving retrieval accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Semantic Chunking: This advanced chunking strategy groups similar sentences, preserving context and improving retrieval relevance compared to simpler methods like fixed-length splitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Retrieval Method Comparison: Exploring alternative retrieval methods, such as BM25 vs. TF-IDF, can lead to significant improvements in RAG system performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Evaluation is Key: Regularly evaluating both retrieval and response metrics is crucial for understanding the impact of changes and optimizing the RAG pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Experimentation: The optimal approach for data preprocessing, chunking, and retrieval often depends on the specific use case. Experimentation is encouraged to find the best configuration for your RAG system.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Scalability and Updates: When building a data ingestion pipeline, consider scalability and the ability to handle periodic updates as data sources change."

    "# Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add more data sources to the RAG system. - Add Jupyter Notbooks from the See wandb/examples repo.\n",
    "2. Use a different chunking method. - Try your own parsing and chunking method.\n",
    "3. Use a small-to-big retrieval method. Where we embed small documents but retrieve big documents -> You can add the parent document to the metadata and modify the `Retriever.search` method."
