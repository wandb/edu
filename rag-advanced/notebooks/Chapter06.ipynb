However, you can manage log files manually or implement a custom solution to handle this task.\\n\\nHere are a couple of approaches you might consider:\\n\\n### 1. Manual Cleanup\\nAfter your experiments are complete and you\\'ve ensured that all data is synced with the W&B servers, you can manually delete the log files from your disk.\\n\\n### 2. Custom Script for Automatic Cleanup\\nYou can write a custom script that runs at the end of your experiments to delete the log files. Here’s a simple example using Python:\\n\\n```python\\nimport os\\nimport shutil\\n\\ndef clean_log_dir(directory):\\n    if os.path.exists(directory):\\n        shutil.rmtree(directory)\\n        print(f\"Log directory {directory} has been removed\")\\n    else:\\n        print(\"Directory does not exist\")\\n\\n# Example usage\\nlog_directory = \\'./wandb\\'\\nclean_log_dir(log_directory)\\n```\\n\\nThis script checks if the directory exists and then removes it along with all its contents. You would need to call this function at the end of your experiment or training session.\\n\\n### 3. Using Python atexit\\nIf you want the cleanup to happen automatically when your Python script exits, you can use the `atexit` module which allows you to register cleanup functions. Here\\'s how you might integrate it:\\n\\n```python\\nimport atexit\\nimport shutil\\n\\ndef cleanup_logs():\\n    log_dir = \\'./wandb\\'\\n    if os.path.exists(log_dir):\\n        shutil.rmtree(log_dir)\\n        print(f\"Cleaned up {log_dir}\")\\n\\natexit.register(cleanup_logs)\\n```\\n\\nThis will ensure that the log directory is cleaned up whenever the Python interpreter terminates normally.\\n\\n### Best Practices\\n- **Ensure Data Integrity**: Always make sure that all your data is properly synced to the W&B servers before deleting any local files to avoid data loss.\\n- **Regular Monitoring**: Keep an eye on the disk space used by W&B logs, especially when running multiple or long-running experiments.\\n- **Use W&B Artifacts**: For managing outputs and datasets more systematically, consider using [W&B Artifacts](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/artifacts) which also supports versioning and is integrated with the W&B dashboard.\\n\\nThese methods provide flexibility depending on your specific needs and environment.', 'contexts': [{'content': 'wandb artifact cache cleanup\\nUsage\\n`wandb artifact cache cleanup [OPTIONS] TARGET_SIZE`\\nSummary\\nClean up less frequently used files from the artifacts cache\\nOptions\\nOption\\nDescription\\n--remove-temp / --no-remove-temp\\nRemove temp files', 'source': 'ref/cli/wandb-artifact/wandb-artifact-cache/wandb-artifact-cache-cleanup.md', 'score': 0.0001323819, 'relevance': 2}, {'content': 'Log Media and Objects in Experiments\\nLog Media and Objects in Experiments\\nLog a dictionary of metrics, media, or custom objects to a step with the W&B Python SDK.

There are several ways to do this:\\nDelete data interactively with the app UI.\\nSet a TTL policy on Artifacts so they are automatically deleted.\", 'source': 'guides/app/features/storage.md', 'score': 0.00024156630000000002, 'relevance': 1}, {'content': 'File count\\nKeep the total number of files uploaded for a single run under 1,000. You can use W&B Artifacts when you need to log a large number of files. Exceeding 1,000 files in a single run can slow down your run pages.\\nPython script performance\\nThere are a few ways that your performance of your python script is reduced:\\nThe size of your data is too large. Large data sizes could introduce a >1 ms overhead to the training loop.\\nThe speed of your network and the how the W&B backend is configured\\nCalling `wandb.log` more than a few times per second. This is due to a small latency added to the training loop every time `wandb.log` is called.\\n:::info\\nIs frequent logging slowing your training runs down? Check out this Colab for methods to get better performance by changing your logging strategy.\\n:::\\nW&B does not assert any limits beyond rate limiting. The W&B Python SDK automatically completes an exponential \"backoff\" and \"retry\" requests that exceed limits. W&B Python SDK responds with a “Network failure” on the command line. For unpaid accounts, W&B may reach out in extreme cases where usage exceeds reasonable thresholds.\\nRate limits\\nW&B SaaS Cloud API implements a rate limit to maintain system integrity and ensure availability. This measure prevents any single user from monopolizing available resources in the shared infrastructure, ensuring that the service remains accessible to all users. You may encounter a lower rate limit for a variety of reasons. \\n:::note\\nRate limits are subject to change.\\n:::\\nThe `wandb.log` calls in your script utilize a metrics logging API to log your training data to W&B. This API is engaged through either online or offline syncing. In either case, it imposes a rate limit quota limit in a rolling time window. This includes limits on total request size and request rate, where latter refers to the number of requests in a time duration. \\nRate limits are applied to each W&B project. So if you have 3 projects in a team, each project has its own rate limit quota. Users on Teams and Enterprise plans have higher rate limits than those on the Free plan.', 'source': 'guides/track/limits.md', 'score': 1.59366e-05, 'relevance': 1}, {'content': 'End a run\\nW&B automatically ends runs and logs data from that run to your W&B project.

      "```python\n",
      "import wandb\n",
      "\n",
      "# Initialize a W&B run\n",

      "In this example, we're logging three metrics: the current epoch, the loss, and the accuracy [1]. You can log any number of metrics as key-value pairs in a dictionary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember to call `wandb.init()` at the beginning of your script to initialize a new run [2]. This sets up the connection to the W&B servers and creates a new experiment in your project.\n",

    "\n",
    "Here are a few key insights from the evaluation of the RAG pipeline iterations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Response Quality Improvement**: The ImprovedV3 pipelines significantly outperformed earlier versions in LLM Response Scorer metrics (0.95 vs 0.75 for baseline), indicating substantial improvements in response quality and correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Trade-off Between Quality and Latency**: While the later iterations (V3 and V4) produced higher quality responses, they also exhibited increased latency. This highlights a common trade-off in AI systems between performance and computational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Incremental Gains**: Each iteration showed improvements in various metrics, demonstrating the value of iterative refinement in prompt engineering and model selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Metric Variability**: Some metrics (e.g., Levenshtein distance) showed unexpected increases in later iterations, reminding us that different evaluation metrics can capture different aspects of performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learnings\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prompt engineering can significantly impact response quality without changing the underlying model.\n",
    "2. Combining refined prompts with more advanced models (as in V4) can lead to synergistic improvements.\n",
    "3. The choice of evaluation metrics is crucial; a holistic view using multiple metrics provides a more comprehensive understanding of system performance.\n",
    "4. In real-world applications, the balance between response quality and latency must be carefully considered based on specific use-case requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "This evaluation underscores the complexity of optimizing RAG systems and the importance of comprehensive, multi-faceted assessment approaches in AI development.\n",

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Iterative Prompt Engineering: Systematic refinement of prompts can significantly enhance response quality without changing the underlying model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Structured Instructions: Clear, detailed prompts with specific roles, formatting guidelines, and edge case handling improve response coherence and relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Example Integration: Including well-crafted examples in prompts helps guide the model towards desired output structure and content quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Reasoning Transparency: Prompting the model to explain its thought process leads to more logical, comprehensive, and trustworthy responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Model-Prompt Synergy: Combining refined prompts with more advanced language models can yield synergistic improvements in response quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Performance Trade-offs: Higher quality responses often come at the cost of increased latency. Balance these factors based on specific use-case requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Multifaceted Evaluation: Use a combination of metrics to comprehensively assess improvements, as different aspects of performance may not all improve uniformly.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Continuous Optimization: RAG system development is an ongoing process. Regularly reassess and refine prompts based on performance data and user feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Scalability and Efficiency: As prompt complexity increases, consider the impact on system efficiency and scalability in real-world applications."
