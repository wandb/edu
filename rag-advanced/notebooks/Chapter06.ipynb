    "2. **Trade-off Between Quality and Latency**: While the later iterations (V3 and V4) produced higher quality responses, they also exhibited increased latency. This highlights a common trade-off in AI systems between performance and computational efficiency.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Prompt engineering can significantly impact response quality without changing the underlying model.\n",
    "2. Combining refined prompts with more advanced models (as in V4) can lead to synergistic improvements.\n",
    "3. The choice of evaluation metrics is crucial; a holistic view using multiple metrics provides a more comprehensive understanding of system performance.\n",

    "2. Structured Instructions: Clear, detailed prompts with specific roles, formatting guidelines, and edge case handling improve response coherence and relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Example Integration: Including well-crafted examples in prompts helps guide the model towards desired output structure and content quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Reasoning Transparency: Prompting the model to explain its thought process leads to more logical, comprehensive, and trustworthy responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Model-Prompt Synergy: Combining refined prompts with more advanced language models can yield synergistic improvements in response quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Performance Trade-offs: Higher quality responses often come at the cost of increased latency. Balance these factors based on specific use-case requirements.\n",
