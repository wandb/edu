To access the `wandb.Run` object from within a `LightningModule` when using `WandbLogger`, you can use the `Trainer.logger.experiment` attribute. This attribute provides direct access to the underlying `wandb.Run` object, allowing you to interact with the Weights & Biases API directly.\\n\\nHere's how you can access the `wandb.Run` object using `WandbLogger` in PyTorch Lightning:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom pytorch_lightning import Trainer, LightningModule\\nfrom pytorch_lightning.loggers import WandbLogger\\n\\nclass MyModel(LightningModule):\\n    def training_step(self, batch, batch_idx):\\n        # Your training logic here\\n        loss = ...\\n\\n        # Log metrics\\n        self.log('train_loss', loss)\\n\\n        # Access the wandb.Run object\\n        run = self.trainer.logger.experiment\\n        # Now you can use `run` to interact with wandb API, e.g., to log additional data\\n        run.log({'additional_metric': value})\\n\\n        return loss\\n\\n# Setup the logger\\nwandb_logger = WandbLogger(project='my_project', entity='my_entity')\\n\\n# Setup the trainer\\ntrainer = Trainer(logger=wandb_logger)\\n\\n# Initialize your model\\nmodel = MyModel()\\n\\n# Train the model\\ntrainer.fit(model)\\n```\\n\\nIn this example:\\n- A `WandbLogger` is instantiated and passed to the `Trainer`.\\n- Inside the `LightningModule`, you can access the `wandb.Run` object via `self.trainer.logger.experiment`.\\n- You can then use this `run` object to log additional data or interact with the Weights & Biases API directly.\\n\\nThis approach allows you to leverage the full capabilities of Weights & Biases directly from your training loop in PyTorch Lightning.\",\n",
