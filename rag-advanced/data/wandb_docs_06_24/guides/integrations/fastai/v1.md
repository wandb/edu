# fastai v1


:::note
This documentation is for fastai v1.
If you use the current version of fastai, you should refer to [fastai page](../intro.md).
:::

For scripts using fastai v1, we have a callback that can automatically log model topology, losses, metrics, weights, gradients, sample predictions and best trained model.

```python
import wandb
from wandb.fastai import WandbCallback

wandb.init()

learn = cnn_learner(data, model, callback_fns=WandbCallback)
learn.fit(epochs)
```

Requested logged data is configurable through the callback constructor.

```python
from functools import partial

learn = cnn_learner(
    data, model, callback_fns=partial(WandbCallback, input_type="images")
)
```

It is also possible to use WandbCallback only when starting training. In this case it must be instantiated.

```python
learn.fit(epochs, callbacks=WandbCallback(learn))
```

Custom parameters can also be given at that stage.

```python
learn.fit(epochs, callbacks=WandbCallback(learn, input_type="images"))
```

## Example Code

We've created a few examples for you to see how the integration works:

## Options

`WandbCallback()` class supports a number of options:

| Keyword argument | Default   | Description                                                                                              |
| ---------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| learn            | N/A       | the fast.ai learner to hook.                                                                             |
| save_model       | True      | save the model if it's improved at each step. It will also load best model at the end of training.       |
| mode             | auto      | 'min', 'max', or 'auto': How to compare the training metric specified in `monitor` between steps.        |
| monitor          | None      | training metric used to measure performance for saving the best model. None defaults to validation loss. |
| log              | gradients | "gradients", "parameters", "all", or None. Losses & metrics are always logged.                           |
| input_type       | None      | "images" or None. Used to display sample predictions.                                                    |
| validation_data  | None      | data used for sample predictions if input_type is set.                                                   |
| predictions      | 36        | number of predictions to make if input_type is set and validation_data is None.                          |
| seed             | 12345     | initialize random generator for sample predictions if input_type is set and validation_data is None.     |
