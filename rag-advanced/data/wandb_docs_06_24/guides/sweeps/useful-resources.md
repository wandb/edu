### Academic papers

Li, Lisha, et al. "[Hyperband: A novel bandit-based approach to hyperparameter optimization.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.06560.pdf)" _The   Journal of Machine Learning Research_ 18.1 (2017): 6765-6816.

### Sweep Experiments

The following W&B Reports demonstrate examples of projects that explore hyperparameter optimization with W&B Sweeps.

* [Drought Watch Benchmark Progress](https://wandb.ai/stacey/droughtwatch/reports/Drought-Watch-Benchmark-Progress--Vmlldzo3ODQ3OQ)
  * Description: Developing the baseline and exploring submissions to the Drought Watch benchmark.
* [Tuning Safety Penalties in Reinforcement Learning](https://wandb.ai/safelife/benchmark-sweeps/reports/Tuning-Safety-Penalties-in-Reinforcement-Learning---VmlldzoyNjQyODM)
  * Description: We examine agents trained with different side effect penalties on three different tasks: pattern creation, pattern removal, and navigation.
* [Meaning and Noise in Hyperparameter Search with W&B](https://wandb.ai/stacey/pytorch\_intro/reports/Meaning-and-Noise-in-Hyperparameter-Search--Vmlldzo0Mzk5MQ) [Stacey Svetlichnaya](https://wandb.ai/stacey)
  * Description: How do we distinguish signal from pareidolia (imaginary patterns)? This article is showcases what is possible with W&B and aims to inspire further exploration.
* [Who is Them? Text Disambiguation with Transformers](https://wandb.ai/stacey/winograd/reports/Who-is-Them-Text-Disambiguation-with-Transformers--VmlldzoxMDU1NTc)
  * Description: Using Hugging Face to explore models for natural language understanding
