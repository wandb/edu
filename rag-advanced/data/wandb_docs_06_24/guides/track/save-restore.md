# Save & Restore Files

<head>
  <title>Save and Restore Files to the Cloud</title>
</head>

This guide first demonstrates how to save files to the cloud with `wandb.save`, then demonstrates how they can be re-created locally with `wandb.restore`.

## Saving Files

Sometimes, rather than logging a numerical value or a piece of media, you want to log a whole file: the weights of a model, the output of other logging software, even source code.

There are two ways to associate a file with a run and upload it to W&B.

1. Use `wandb.save(filename)`.
2. Put a file in the wandb run directory, and it will get uploaded at the end of the run.

:::info
If you're [resuming](../runs/resuming.md) a run, you can recover a file by calling`wandb.restore(filename)`
:::

If you want to sync files as they're being written, you can specify a filename or glob in `wandb.save`.

### Examples of `wandb.save`

See [this report](https://app.wandb.ai/lavanyashukla/save\_and\_restore/reports/Saving-and-Restoring-Models-with-W%26B--Vmlldzo3MDQ3Mw) for a complete working example.

```python
# Save a model file from the current directory
wandb.save("model.h5")

# Save all files that exist containing the substring "ckpt"
wandb.save("../logs/*ckpt*")

# Save files starting with "checkpoint" as they're written to
wandb.save(os.path.join(wandb.run.dir, "checkpoint*"))
```

:::info
W&B's local run directories are by default inside the `./wandb` directory relative to your script, and the path looks like `run-20171023_105053-3o4933r0` where `20171023_105053` is the timestamp and `3o4933r0` is the ID of the run. You can set the `WANDB_DIR` [environment variable](environment-variables.md), or the `dir` keyword argument of [`wandb.init`](./launch.md), to an absolute path and files will be written within that directory instead.
:::

### Save Policies and relative paths

`wandb.save` accepts a **policy** argument which is set to "**live**" by default. Available policies are:

* **live (default)** - sync this file to a wandb server immediately and re-sync it if it changes
* **now** - sync this file to a wandb server immediately, don't continue syncing if it changes
* **end** - only sync the file when the run finishes

You can also specify the **base\_path** argument to `wandb.save`. This would allow you to maintain a directory hierarchy, for example:

```python
wandb.save(path="./results/eval/*", base_path="./results", policy="now")
```

Would result in all files matching the pattern being saved in an `eval` folder instead of at the root.

:::info
When `wandb.save` is called it will list all files that exist at the provided path and create symlinks for them into the run directory (`wandb.run.dir`). If you create new files in the same path after calling `wandb.save` we will not sync them. You should either write files directly to `wandb.run.dir` or be sure to call `wandb.save` anytime new files are created.
:::

### Example of saving a file to the wandb run directory

The file `model.h5` is saved into the `wandb.run.dir` and will be uploaded at the end of training.

```python
import wandb

wandb.init()

model.fit(
    X_train,
    y_train,
    validation_data=(X_test, y_test),
    callbacks=[wandb.keras.WandbCallback()],
)
model.save(os.path.join(wandb.run.dir, "model.h5"))
```

Here's a public example page. You can see on the files tab, there's a `model-best.h5`. That's automatically saved by default by the Keras integration, but you can save a checkpoint manually and we'll store it for you in association with your run.

## Restoring Files

Calling `wandb.restore(filename)`will restore a file into your local run directory. Typically`filename` refers to a file generated by an earlier experiment run and uploaded to our cloud with `wandb.save`. This call will make a local copy of the file and return a local file stream open for reading.

Common use cases:

* restore the model architecture or weights generated by past runs (for more complicated version control use cases, see our [Artifacts](../artifacts/intro.md).
* resume training from the last checkpoint in the case of failure (see the section on [resuming](../runs/resuming.md) for important details)

### Examples of `wandb.restore`

See [this report](https://app.wandb.ai/lavanyashukla/save\_and\_restore/reports/Saving-and-Restoring-Models-with-W%26B--Vmlldzo3MDQ3Mw) for a complete working example.

```python
# restore a model file from a specific run by user "vanpelt" in "my-project"
best_model = wandb.restore("model-best.h5", run_path="vanpelt/my-project/a1b2c3d")

# restore a weights file from a checkpoint
# (NOTE: resuming must be configured if run_path is not provided)
weights_file = wandb.restore("weights.h5")
# use the "name" attribute of the returned object
# if your framework expects a filename, e.g. as in Keras
my_predefined_model.load_weights(weights_file.name)
```

> If you don't specify a `run_path`, you'll need to configure [resuming](../runs/resuming.md) for your run. If you want access to files programmatically outside of training, use the [Run API](../../ref/python/run.md).

## Common Questions

### How do I ignore files?

You can edit the `wandb/settings` file and set `ignore_globs` equal to a comma separated list of [globs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob\_\(programming\)). You can also set the `WANDB_IGNORE_GLOBS` [environment variable](./environment-variables.md). A common use case is to prevent the git patch that we automatically create from being uploaded i.e. `WANDB_IGNORE_GLOBS=*.patch`.


### Change directory for saving files

If you default to saving files in AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage, you might get this error:`events.out.tfevents.1581193870.gpt-tpu-finetune-8jzqk-2033426287 is a cloud storage url, can't save file to wandb.`

To change the log directory for TensorBoard events files or other files you'd like us to sync, save your files to the `wandb.run.dir` so they're synced to our cloud.

### How do I get the name of a run?

If you'd like to use the run name from within your script, you can use `wandb.run.name` and you'll get the run name— "blissful-waterfall-2" for example.

You need to call save on the run before you can access the display name:

```
run = wandb.init(...)
run.save()
print(run.name)
```

### How can I push all saved files from local?

Call `wandb.save("*.pt")` once at the top of your script after `wandb.init`, then all files that match that pattern will save immediately once they're written to `wandb.run.dir`.

### Can I remove local files that have already been synced to cloud storage?

There’s a command `wandb sync --clean` that you can run to remove local files that have already been synced to cloud storage. More information about usage can be found with `wandb sync --help`

### What if I want to restore the state of my code?

Use the `restore` command of our [command line tool](../../ref/cli/README.md) to return to the state of your code when you ran a given run.

```shell
# creates a branch and restores the code to the state
# it was in when run $RUN_ID was executed
wandb restore $RUN_ID
```

### How does `wandb` capture the state of the code?

When `wandb.init` is called from your script, a link is saved to the last git commit if the code is in a git repository. A diff patch is also created in case there are uncommitted changes or changes that are out of sync with your remote.
