    "## Why Evaluate LLMs?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Traditional Software vs LLM Testing\n",
    "Unlike traditional software where outputs are deterministic and can be unit tested, LLMs produce:\n",
    "- Non-deterministic outputs that vary between runs\n",
    "- Complex, open-ended responses for tasks like summarization and dialogue\n",
    "- Outputs that require nuanced evaluation of quality, accuracy, and safety\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Reasons for LLM Evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Quality Assurance\n",
    "- Conventional metrics (n-grams, semantic similarity) are insufficient for complex LLM tasks\n",
    "- Need to assess multiple dimensions like factuality, coherence, and relevance\n",
    "- Important to catch potential hallucinations and factual inconsistencies\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Safety & Alignment \n",
    "- Ensure outputs are safe and non-toxic\n",
    "- Verify adherence to ethical guidelines and business policies\n",
    "- Maintain alignment with intended use cases and user expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Performance Monitoring\n",
    "- Track model performance across different tasks and domains\n",
    "- Identify areas needing improvement or fine-tuning\n",
    "- Compare different model versions or configurations\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Business Goals\n",
    "- Validate that outputs meet specific business requirements\n",
    "- Ensure cost-effective deployment of LLM solutions\n",
    "- Maintain quality standards for production systems"
